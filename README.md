Classifier.zip instructions (rough notes)
- Test this on your local to see if it’s working
- run the “evaluate_image” notebook
- you can change the “victim_no” to your number
- it’s pulling form a sample of 3 images with one of them designed to trigger the stolen car alert (the Acura)
- the capture_image notebook is designed to take pictures from an open webcam and will input into the images file
- let me know if works we can convert to python file that can be run with arguments from terminal

list of stolen cars is a live list from that website

so will change as it changes
